"""Script to post to AutoLovecraft.tumblr.com. Really rough sketch of a
script here. Not really meant for public use. Based on my earlier script to
do a similar job for the IrishLitDiscourses Tumblr account; see
https://github.com/patrick-brian-mooney/IrishLitDiscourses-python

The fact that there isn't real documentation here is intentionally meant to
reinforce that this is a rough draft not meant for public use. Use at your own
risk. My hope is that this script is helpful, but I explicitly disclaim ANY
RESPONSIBILITY for the behavior of this piece of work. If you don't have the
expertise to evaluate its risks, it's not for you. To put it more bluntly: THIS
SOFTWARE IS OFFERED WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND AT ALL.

# Thanks to https://epicjefferson.wordpress.com/2014/09/28/python-to-tumblr/
for first steps here when I was first cutting my teeth on Python.
